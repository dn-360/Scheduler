# Scheduler For Study Buddies (SfBS)
This web app allows students to schedule meetings using locations and preferences.
## Inspiration
We were inspired by what we could make with the technologies we were given such as Google Cloud and the Twilio API for messaging.
## What it does
The app allows students to search for other students to study with. Users can register, log in, search for students using Google Maps and preferences (we used varieties of eggs as an example) and message each other to schedule meetings.
## How we built it
We first designed the app in Figma. Then we copied over the design to our HTML pages, transferring over elements and . We also added google maps functionality into our map search page.
## Challenges we ran into
Most of our challenges were related to creating the HTML pages. Our pages use CSS for styling and Figma does utilize CSS elements which we transferred over to our application. A majority of our time was spent making the elements scale properly so that the page would look the same regardless of resolution or window size.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the pages we created, specifically our designs and the ability to go to other pages from the initial login page.
## What we learned
We realized how difficult it is to create a full application in such a short time. It is easy for us to create HTML pages but a full application that takes advantage of APIs and other technologies does require a substantial amount of work.
## What's next for Scheduler
The biggest thing for this app next is to implement the Twilio API for students to message each other. Some other things to do are to implement the login/signup feature and make further improvements to the design.
